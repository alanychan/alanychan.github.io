            Originally from the tropical paradise island of Mauritius, I started my
            career in the Tech world thanks to the sound advice of a friend's uncle. 
            The tech industry being a strongly male-dominated world, I took up the challenge 
            to prove to myself that I was as much capable as any one of them. And succeeded, with hard work & dedication.
            Every 5 years or so, I do a retrospection and after a decade or so, I decided to see what I've missed (kind of).. 
            & left everything behind to build a new career as an early childhood educator, here in Perth :)
            Another 5 years gone & I found myself having achieved what I aimed for - being the safe anchor for the little ones for 
            when their parents aren't with them & contributing to their holistic development. 
            Then covid hit & the industry is in crisis. The tech world is calling me back & I found She Codes in 2021.
          </p>

            2022, I'm a She Codes Plus Cohort & so begins a new adventure!
